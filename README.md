# Flappy-Bird

This is my recreation of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird in Python using Pygame modules.

HOW TO PLAY: You control a fish, and you must not hit the incoming pipes, or else you lose. Each set of pipes will have varying heights, and you must press the spacebar to control your character to fit in between the upper and lower bounds without touching the pipes. See how long you can survive!

To run the game, download the main python file named "FlappyBird.py". Also download the image files, in addition to the Python and Pygame applications.
